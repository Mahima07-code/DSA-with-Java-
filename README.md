# DSA-with-Java-
This repository is to keep track of my DSA journey.

üìö DSA with Java ‚Äì Daily Problem Solving üíª
This repository is dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java with a commitment to solving at least one DSA problem every day.
It includes basic to advanced level questions with solutions .

üõ†Ô∏è What's inside:
‚úÖ Daily DSA problems with Java solutions
üí° Optimized code with clear explanations
üìå Categorized by topics (Arrays, Strings, Trees, DP, etc.)
üîÅ Updated every day with consistency

üöÄ Goal:
To build strong problem-solving skills, crack coding interviews, and stay consistent on the DSA journey.

Roadmap followed :-

Step 1 :-
‚¶Å	Choose a language -> JAVA
‚¶Å	Basics of language -> Syntax
‚¶Å	Easy questions -> Pattern


Step 2 :- Data Structures
‚¶Å	Linear -> Array , Linked List
‚¶Å	Non Linear -> Tree, Graph
‚¶Å	Array -> sliding window, kadane's algo, prefix sum
‚¶Å	Linkedlist -> reversing, cycle detection, slow and fast pointer
‚¶Å	Leetcode problem (easy medium of AL)


Step 3 :- ( take u forward playlist )
‚¶Å	Stack -> Next greater Element , implementation of stack using AL
‚¶Å	Queues -> SLiding window max.,implementation of queues usong AL
‚¶Å	Hashmaps -> Two sum , longest subarray with sum K
‚¶Å	Leetcode problem (easy medium of SQH)


Step 4 :- (Aditya Verma playlist of RB)
‚¶Å	Recursion -> fibonacci, factorial, tower of hanoi
‚¶Å	Backtrcaking -> N queens, subset generation , sudoku solver
‚¶Å	Leetcode problem (easy medium of RB )


Step 5 :- Non linear DS (take u forward)
‚¶Å	Fundamental -> contruction, traversal, usage
‚¶Å	Tree -> traversal, views, lowest tree ancestor, diameter of tree
‚¶Å	Graph -> traversal, detecting cycle, shortest path algo
‚¶Å	Leetcode


Step 6 :- Dyanamic Programming (Aditya verma DP)
‚¶Å	Beginner -> fibbonacci, coin change, climbing stairs
‚¶Å	Advance ->  knapsack, partition, longest increasing subsequence, matrix chain multiplication
‚¶Å	Leetcode


Step 7 :-
‚¶Å	Revision and Practice
‚¶Å	weekly contest

HOPE this helps you too.
