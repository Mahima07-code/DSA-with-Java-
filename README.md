# DSA-with-Java-
This repository is to keep track of my DSA journey.

📚 DSA with Java – Daily Problem Solving 💻<br>
This repository is dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java with a commitment to solving at least one DSA problem every day.<br>
It includes basic to advanced level questions with solutions .

🛠️ What's inside:<br>
✅ Daily DSA problems with Java solutions<br>
💡 Optimized code with clear explanations<br>
📌 Categorized by topics (Arrays, Strings, Trees, DP, etc.)<br>
🔁 Updated every day with consistency<br>

🚀 Goal:<br>
To build strong problem-solving skills, crack coding interviews, and stay consistent on the DSA journey.

Roadmap followed :-

Step 1 :-<br>
⦁	Choose a language -> JAVA<br>
⦁	Basics of language -> Syntax<br>
⦁	Easy questions -> Pattern<br>


Step 2 :- Data Structures<br>
⦁	Linear -> Array , Linked List<br>
⦁	Non Linear -> Tree, Graph<br>
⦁	Array -> sliding window, kadane's algo, prefix sum<br>
⦁	Linkedlist -> reversing, cycle detection, slow and fast pointer<br>
⦁	Leetcode problem (easy medium of AL)<br>


Step 3 :- ( take u forward playlist )<br>
⦁	Stack -> Next greater Element , implementation of stack using AL<br>
⦁	Queues -> SLiding window max.,implementation of queues usong AL<br>
⦁	Hashmaps -> Two sum , longest subarray with sum K<br>
⦁	Leetcode problem (easy medium of SQH)<br>


Step 4 :- (Aditya Verma playlist of RB)<br>
⦁	Recursion -> fibonacci, factorial, tower of hanoi<br>
⦁	Backtrcaking -> N queens, subset generation , sudoku solver<br>
⦁	Leetcode problem (easy medium of RB )<br>


Step 5 :- Non linear DS (take u forward)<br>
⦁	Fundamental -> contruction, traversal, usage<br>
⦁	Tree -> traversal, views, lowest tree ancestor, diameter of tree<br>
⦁	Graph -> traversal, detecting cycle, shortest path algo<br>
⦁	Leetcode<br>


Step 6 :- Dyanamic Programming (Aditya verma DP)<br>
⦁	Beginner -> fibbonacci, coin change, climbing stairs<br>
⦁	Advance ->  knapsack, partition, longest increasing subsequence, matrix chain multiplication<br>
⦁	Leetcode<br>


Step 7 :-<br>
⦁	Revision and Practice<br>
⦁	weekly contest<br>

HOPE this helps you too.<br>
